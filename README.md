# Discord Clone üöÄ

A real-time, full-stack chat application inspired by Discord. This project leverages a powerful combination of Spring Boot for the backend, React JS for the frontend, and WebSockets for seamless, bidirectional communication. The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application is designed with a decoupled frontend and backend architecture:

* **Frontend**: A responsive user interface built with **React JS**. It is served statically using an **Nginx** web server.
* **Backend**: A robust API built with **Spring Boot**. It handles business logic, user authentication, and message persistence.
* **Real-time Communication**: **STOMP over WebSocket** is used to enable real-time messaging between the clients and the server.
* **Database**: **MongoDB** is used as the NoSQL database to store messages, user data.
* **Containerization**: The entire stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) is orchestrated using **Docker Compose**, ensuring a consistent development and production environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Workflow

The following diagrams illustrate the core operational flows of the application.

## User Authentication & Session Management

<img width="1402" height="804" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 135510" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe6c706-1dd0-4de5-86fa-096d6bdbf9e3" />

The authentication process is initiated when a user submits their credentials. The **Spring Boot** backend validates these against the **MongoDB** database. Upon success, a **JWT** is generated and returned to the client. The **React** frontend then persists the token and user data in the **Redux Store** and establishes a WebSocket connection for real-time updates.

## Group Management & Join Requests

<img width="1237" height="755" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 140217" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52df9c0d-0404-44c3-944a-f93f954239f1" />

Users can create public or private groups. Joining a public group is instantaneous, with the backend directly adding the user. For private groups, a join request is sent to the backend, which then notifies the group owner in real-time. The owner's decision (accept/reject) is processed by the backend, updating the request status and notifying the original user of the outcome via WebSocket.

## Real-Time Messaging

<img width="1797" height="551" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 140334" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a12f35-cca4-41e6-a06c-7b2f89566a9f" />

Once connected, a user sends a message through the **WebSocket Client**. The message is transmitted to the **Spring Boot** backend via its STOMP endpoint. The backend first persists the message in **MongoDB** for chat history and then broadcasts it to all members subscribed to that specific group's topic, ensuring instantaneous delivery.

## User Logout

<img width="1339" height="242" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 140035" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32668ec-b0f9-4fe0-853e-5f6af208bc60" />

During logout, the client-side action clears the user's session data from the **Redux Store** and removes the persisted state. Simultaneously, it sends a command to disconnect from the **WebSocket Server**, gracefully terminating the real-time communication channel.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository acts as a parent project that orchestrates the backend and frontend using Docker. The actual source code for the frontend and backend services resides in separate Git submodules.

* `chat-application-backend/`: The Spring Boot backend service.
* `chat-application-frontend/`: The React JS frontend application.
* `docker-compose.yml`: The Docker Compose file to build and run the entire application stack.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can get the entire application running on your local machine with just a few commands, thanks to Docker.

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
### Method 1: Build from Source

1.  **Clone the repository with its submodules:**
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/saadmdsabah/Discord-Clone-using-Spring-boot-Stomp-Client-and-React-JS.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Discord-Clone-using-Spring-boot-Stomp-Client-and-React-JS
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build the custom Docker images from the source code and then start all the services.

### Method 2: Use Pre-built Images (Faster)

If you don't need to build the images from the source code, you can pull them directly from Docker Hub.

1.  **Pull the latest pre-built images:**
    ```bash
    docker pull saadsabahuddin/discord-clone-backend:latest
    docker pull saadsabahuddin/discord-clone-frontend:latest
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository (submodules are not needed):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/saadmdsabah/Discord-Clone-using-Spring-boot-Stomp-Client-and-React-JS.git](https://github.com/saadmdsabah/Discord-Clone-using-Spring-boot-Stomp-Client-and-React-JS.git)
    cd Discord-Clone-using-Spring-boot-Stomp-Client-and-React-JS
    ```

3.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This will use the images you pulled instead of building them locally.

### Access the Application

Once the containers are running (using either method), open your web browser and navigate to:
**[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**
